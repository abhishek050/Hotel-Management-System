# Hotel-Management-System

-	Developed a system application by using swing, jdbc and core java concepts,
  The main objective of the application is to make a hotel management system which is responsible for managing the all the hotel services including room booking , catering , velvet parking etc.
-	There are mainly two interfaces , one is for admin and the other one for customers .
-	I used XAMPP local Server to communicate with the application.
-	I used MySQL database for storing and retrieving data.
